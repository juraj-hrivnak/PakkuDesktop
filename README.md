## About

Pakku Desktop is the modern modpack manager for Minecraft modpack developers and enthusiasts.

Build, customise, and manage your modpacks in a modern, intuitive interface. Powered by the Pakku backend, Pakku Desktop brings fast, reliable, and visual modpack development to everyone.



## Why use Pakku Desktop?

Pakku Desktop is a modpack manager, not a launcher. Meaning it can (and should) be used alongside any launcher of your choice.

In contrast to modpack launchers, Pakku enables support for version control, simplifies collaboration options, and adds support for CI/CD.
