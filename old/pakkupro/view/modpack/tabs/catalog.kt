## About

With **Pakku**, you can create modpacks for **CurseForge**, **Modrinth** or **both simultaneously**.

### Multiplatform :dna: 

Modpack development with the split of mod hosting platforms has become significantly harder. Pakku addresses this problem and tries to be as helpful as possible when developing a multiplatform modpack.

When adding a mod, resource pack or shader (further referred to as "Project") to your modpack, Pakku has a robust way to find it across both platforms. And even If this fails, you can specify the project slug, ID, or version manually.

### Optimized :abacus: 

Pakku is multithreaded to ensure everything is done as quickly as possible.

Pakku is also efficient with its HTTP requests, reducing them to a minimum. This ensures that data is sent quicker back to you and that you do not get rate-limited by adding or updating too many projects at once.

### Configurable :nut_and_bolt: 

Pakku utilises a design used by many well-known package managers like npm or Cargo, which consists of two files, the config file and the lock file.

This allows you to fine-tune your modpack, while still being up-to-date. If any data retrieved from the platforms does not suit your requirements, you can simply override it in the config file.
